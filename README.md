# ads-extension-telemetry

## Overview
This module provides a consistent way for first-party extensions to report telemetry over Application Insights.

The module respects the user's decision about whether or not to send telemetry data through the `telemetry.enableTelemetry` setting in Azure Data Studio.

Follow [guide to set up Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-nodejs-quick-start) in Azure and get your key.

## Installation
`npm install ads-extension-telemetry`

## Usage
 ```javascript
 const vscode = require('vscode');
 const TelemetryReporter = require('ads-extension-telemetry');

 // all events will be prefixed with this event name
 const extensionId = '<your extension unique name>';

 // extension version will be reported as a property with each event
 const extensionVersion = '<your extension version>';

 // the application insights key (also known as instrumentation key)
 const key = '<your key>';

// telemetry reporter
 let reporter;

 function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    ...
    // create telemetry reporter on extension activation
    reporter = new TelemetryReporter(extensionId, extensionVersion, key);
    // ensure it gets property disposed
    context.subscriptions.push(reporter);
    ...
 }

 function deactivate() {
   // This will ensure all pending events get flushed
    reporter.dispose();
 }

 ...
 // send event any time after activation

 // Immediately send event
 reporter.sendViewEvent('ConnectionDialog');
 reporter.sendActionEvent('ConnectionDialog', 'Click', 'OKButton', 'Mouse', 123);
 reporter.sendMetricsEvent({ 'dialogLoadTimeMs', 578 }, 'ConnectionDialog');
 reporter.sendErrorEvent('ConnectionDialog', 'connectionFailed', '4060', 'SqlException');

// Add on additional properties and then send event
reporter.createViewEvent('ConnectionDialog')
	.withAdditionalProperties( { myProp: 'MyPropValue' })
	.withAdditionalMeasurements( { myMeasure: 123 })
	.withConnectionInfo(connectionProfile)
	.send();
  ```

## Releasing

Release a new version of the extension by:

1. Ensuring all changes are merged in and the package version is updated
2. Create a new [Github Release](https://github.com/microsoft/azdata-test/releases) and tag targeting the main branch
3. The CD pipeline will then run and automatically attach the built tgz to the release, go to it and download that file
4. Run `npm publish <path to tarball>`
